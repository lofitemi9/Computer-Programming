    "The RA Programming & Bulletin‑Board Management System is a Python script that automates tracking of Resident Assistant tasks stored in your “Programming Tracker & Requirements” spreadsheet. It reads each RA’s worksheet and the master sheet, validates inputs, monitors completion of community meetings, bulletin boards, and program requirements, and uses loops and lists to generate reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks. The tool outputs updated reports for managers, ensuring RAs meet programming and community‑building responsibilities"
